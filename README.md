# Multivariate-Regression-Analysis

<h2>Description</h2>

Looking for a way to predict box office receipts, an MGM producer collects the production costs, promotional
costs, and book adaptation sales for 10 randomly sampled blockbuster movies, as well as their box office
ticket sales (in millions of dollars). This year, heâ€™s pulling out all the stops on his newest feature film. He
is planning to spend 15 million on production costs, 20 million on promotional costs, and hopes to make 5
million on sales of book adaptations.
